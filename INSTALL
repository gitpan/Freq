There is a conflict between Inline 0.44 version of Inline::MakeMaker and the default layout of modules in Perl. To get around this the following procedure must be used:

tar zxvf Freq.tar.gz
cd Freq
perl Makefile.PL
[edit Makefile. Change ".pm.inl" to "Freq.inl" close to the end of the file.]
make test
make install
